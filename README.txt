v2 - made algorithms efficient, removing unnecessary arrays and reworking functions
v2.1 - added stopwatch to count nanoseconds spent by Djikstra's algorithm

v3 - ported to c++




possible improvements:
Djikstra's algorithm should not be part of graph class. Maybe use strategy design pattern.
